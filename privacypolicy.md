**Privacy Policy for Cold Sore Tracker
Last Updated: 12 May 2025**

This is the privacy policy for the mobile application Cold Sore Tracker (the "App"). This page informs you of the policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use the App and the choices you have associated with that data.

**Collection of Information**

I believe that providing a service should not come at the cost of compromising your privacy. Thatâ€™s why I have chosen not to collect, store, or process any personal information from users of Cold Sore Tracker. I do not collect, store, or process any personal information from users of Cold Sore Tracker. I have also restricted advertisements to serve non-personalised ads only.

**Local Data Storage**

All data entered into Cold Sore Tracker (including cold sore records, treatment information, and settings) is stored locally on your device only. This information never leaves your device and is not accessible to me or any third parties.

**Data Deletion**

Since all data is stored locally on your device, you can delete your data at any time by either:
Using the data deletion function within the app
Uninstalling the application from your device

**Google AdMob Advertising**

The App uses Google AdMob to display advertisements. The app is configured to use non-personalised ads only, which limits data collection. With non-personalised ads:

No persistent advertising identifiers are used for ad personalisation
No browsing history or interest profiles are created
No demographic targeting is applied

Google AdMob may still collect limited technical information necessary for ad delivery:
General device information (OS version, model)
IP address (typically anonymised)
General location (country/city level, not precise GPS)
Basic app usage statistics

This limited data collection is necessary for ad functionality but is not used to build a personalised advertising profile. For more information about how Google uses data, please visit: https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites

**Your Privacy Choices**

Since ads are non-personalised, you do not need to opt-in or opt-out of personalised tracking. Google AdMob is configured to deliver ads that are not based on your personal data.

**Third-party Links and Services**

The App may contain links to external websites or services not operated by me (e.g. following an advertisement). I strongly advise you to review the privacy policy of every third-party service you visit.

**Children's Privacy**

The App does not target or collect information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has used my App, please contact me immediately so the necessary deletion can take place.

**Apple App Store**

Apple's App Store may collect certain information in connection with your download and use of the App. This collection is subject to Apple's Privacy Policy: https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date.

**Contact Details**

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact me at: email


By using the App, you consent to this Privacy Policy.
